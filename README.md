Frozen is an open source HTML5 game engine.
===========================================

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/iceddev/frozen.png?branch=0.2.0)](http://travis-ci.org/iceddev/frozen)

## Examples

Examples can be found at https://github.com/iceddev/frozen/tree/master/examples

## Building

Warning: don't run `npm install` unless you need raw source, as this will use volo to install dojo, dojo utils, dcl, and Box2D

If you want to build from source, run:

1. `npm install` to get all the NPM dependencies and start the `volo add`
2. `grunt dojo` to start the dojo build
3. Optionally, `grunt jsdoc` will generate docs

More documentation coming.  Promise :)
